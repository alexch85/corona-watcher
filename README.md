Coronawatcher covid-19 tracker app

A React project I created to raise awareness of the growing corona pandemic through the visual presentation of real-time data fetched from a popular covid-19 API, users can filter data by country and choose between regular and dark mode.

Technologies used: React, Chart JS for data representation, Material UI.
