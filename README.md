Coronawatcher covid-19 tracker app

A React project I created to raise awareness of the growing corona pandemic through the visual presentation of real-time data fetched from a popular covid-19 API, users can filter data by country and choose between regular and dark mode.

The goal of this project was to practice fetching data from a remote API. Modifying the data and presenting it in an accessible way using the Chart JS library. I also used the Material UI library to style some of my components.
